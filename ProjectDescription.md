# Mini Social Networking App (VTConnect)

**This project is part of Virginia Tech CS5040 course with Prof. Tessema Mengistu.**

In this project, we are going to develop a mini social networking application called, VTConnect. A social networking service or SNS (sometimes called a social networking site) is an online platform, which people use to build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career content, interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections. Most social networking apps use graph data structure as one of the underlying data structures. 

In this project, you will build a simple social networking app that uses graph data structure.  The following is a simple demo of the system.

**Implementation/Classes** 

This project will be built using a number of classes representing the component pieces of the VTConnect.  We are going to use built-in java classes and interfaces extensively for the implementation of the project. Below are the descriptions of these classes and interfaces.  

**INTERFACE (GraphInterface)**: **GraphInterface.java** 

This interface represents all the functionalities of the graph data structure you are going to use in this project.  The graph that we are going to use to implement VTConnect is **undirected graph**. 

**Operations** 

+**addVertex(T vertexLabel): boolean**  - Adds a given vertex to this graph. If vertexLabel is null, it returns false.  

**+removeVertex(T vertexLabel): VertexInterface<T>**   - Removes a vertex with the given vertexLabel from this graph and returns the removed vertex. If vertex does not exist, it will return null.  

**+addEdge(T begin, T end, double edgeWeight): boolean**- Adds a weighted edge between two given distinct vertices that are currently in this graph. The desired edge must not already be in the graph. Note that the graph is undirected graph. 

**+addEdge(T begin, T end):boolean**  - Adds an unweighted edge between two given distinct vertices that are currently in this graph. The desired edge must not already be in the graph.  

**+removeEdge(T begin, T end, double edgeWeight): boolean**- Removes a weighted edge between two given distinct vertices that are currently in this graph. The desired edge must already be in the graph. It returns true if the removal is successful, false otherwise. 

**+removeEdge(T begin, T end):boolean**  - Removes an unweighted edge between two given distinct vertices that are currently in this graph. The desired edge must already be in the graph. It returns true if the removal is successful, false otherwise 

**+hasEdge(T begin, T end):boolean**   - Sees whether an undirected edge exists between two given vertices.  

**+getNumberOfVertices (): int**  - This method returns the number of Vertices in this graph. 

**+getNumberOfEdges (): int**  - This method returns the number of undirected Edges in this graph. 

**+isEmpty():boolean**  -   This method returns true, if this graph is empty, false otherwise. 

**+getVertices():List<VertexInterface<T>>**  -   This method returns the list of all vertices in the graph. If the graph is empty, it returns null. 

**+clear():void** – clears the graph. 

**+getBreadthFirstTraversal(T origin):Queue<T>**  -   Performs a breadth- first traversal of a graph and returns the queue that contains the result. Empty queue can be returned.  

**+getShortestPath(T  origin,  T  destination,  Stack<T>  path): int**   -   returns the shortest distance between the origin and destination. If a path does not exist, it returns the maximum integer (to simulate infinity).  

## **INTERFACE (VertexInterface)**: **VertexInterface.java** 

This interface represents all the functionalities of a Vertex in a graph.  **Operations** 

**+getLabel(): T**  - Gets this vertex’s label. 

**+getNumberOfNeighbors():int**   - Returns the number of neighbors of this vertex. 

**+visit(): void**  - Marks this vertex as visited. **+unvisit(): void**  - Removes this vertex’s visited mark. 

**+isVisited():boolean**  -   Returns true if the vertex is visited, false otherwise.  

**+connect(VertexInterface<T> endVertex, double edgeWeight): boolean**- Connects this vertex and endVertex with a weighted edge.  The two vertices cannot be the same, and must not already have this edge between them. Two vertices are equal (same)if their labels are equal (same). Returns true if the connection is successful, false otherwise.  

**+connect(VertexInterface<T> endVertex): boolean**- Connects this vertex and endVertex with a unweighted edge.  The two vertices cannot be the same, and must not already have this edge between them. Two vertices are equal (same)if their labels are equal (same). Returns true if the connection is successful, false otherwise. 

**+disconnect(VertexInterface<T> endVertex, double edgeWeight): boolean**- Disconnects this vertex from a given vertex with a weighted edge, i.e., removes the edge.  The Edge should exist in order to be disconnected. Returns true if the disconnection is successful, false otherwise. **+disconnect(VertexInterface<T> endVertex): boolean**- Disconnects this vertex from a given vertex with an unweighted edge.  The Edge should exist in order to be disconnected. Returns true if the disconnection is successful, false otherwise. 

**+getNeighborIterator():Iterator<VertexInterface<T>>**  –  creates  an iterator of this vertex's neighbors by following all edges that begin at this vertex. 

**+hasNeighbor():boolean** – Sees whether this vertex has at least one neighbor. 

**+getUnvisitedNeighbor():VertexInterface<T>**  –  Gets  an  unvisited neighbor, if any, of this vertex. 

**+setPredecessor(VertexInterface<T>  predecessor):void**  –  Records  the previous vertex on a path to this vertex. 

**+getPredecessor():VertexInterface<T>**  – Gets the recorded predecessor of this vertex. 

**+hasPredecessor():boolean**– Sees whether a predecessor was recorded for this vertex. 

**+setCost(double newCost):  void**– Records the cost of a path to this vertex. 

**+getCost():  double**– Returns the cost of a path to this vertex. 

**Note that these interfaces should be generic, i.e., it should be able to accommodate any type of object. The VTConnect is just an example application that uses these interfaces.** 

## **CLASS (Vertex) Vertex.java** 

This generic class implements the VertexInterface. The class has the following attributes:  

- **label: T** – Represents the label of the vertex. 
- **visited: boolean**        -  Stores if the vertex is visited or not, true if visited. 
- **previousVertex: VertexInterface<T>**        - on path to this vertex 
- **cost: double**                             -  of path to this vertex  
- **edgeList: List<Edge>**  - list of edges to neighbors. Note that there is an Edge class used.  

**+Vertex(T vertexLabel): constructor**  - initializes label to the given value, visited → false, cost → 0.0, previousVertex →null, and the edgeList to a default list.

## **CLASS (VTConnect)**: **VTConnect.java**

This  class is the main class of the social networking app. It **has a graph of profiles** that are connected together to create the social network of users. Each user is represented by a  profile object. It also has the following behaviors:  

**+VTConnect(): constructor**  - initializes the social networking app. 

**+addUser(Profile p):void** -   Adds a new user to the social network. 

**+removeUser(Profile p):Profile** -   Removes an existing user from  the social network. If the user does not exist, it returns null. 

**+createFriendship(Profile  a,  Profile  b):boolean**    -  Creates  a friendship between two users on VTConnect. If the friendship is created successfully, it returns true, false otherwise.  

**+removeFriendship(Profile a, Profile b):boolean**   removes a friendship between two users on VTConnect. If the friendship is discontinued successfully, it returns true, false otherwise. 

**+hasFriendship(Profile a, Profile b): boolean**- Returns true if there is friendship between Profiles a and b, false otherwise. 

**+traverse(Profile startPoint): void**  - this method displays each profile's  information  and  friends,  starting  from  the  startPoint profile. See the sample run on the format of the display.   

**+exists(Profile user): boolean**- this returns true if a user with the given profile exists in VTConnect, false otherwise.   

**+friendSuggestion(Profile user): List<Profile>**- Returns a list of Profiles, who are friends with one or more of the profile's friends (but not currently the profile's friend). It returns null, if the user does not exist or if it does not have any friend suggestions. Take a look at the sample run for an example.  

**+friendshipDistance(Profile a, Profile b): int**- Returns the friendship distance between two profiles. A friendship distance is simply how many profiles away the two profiles are. For example, if a and b are friends their friendship distance is 1. If they have a common friend but they are not friends, their friendship distance is 2. If either of the profiles are not in the social networking app, the method returns -1.**
